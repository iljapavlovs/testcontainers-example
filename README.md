# Selenide + TestContainers (Docker)

#### NOTE - Project is based on https://github.com/selenide-examples/testcontainers.git

This is a sample project showing how to run tests in Docker with help of TestContainer library.

Look for `GoogleTestWithDocker` to see how to run Docker with just a single annotation!

For reference, look for `GoogleTest` to see how the same test runs without Docker.
